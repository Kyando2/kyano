        **ATTRIBUTE TYPES**

        There are four different attribute types; NATIVE, INHERITED, ADDED and GETTER
        NATIVE:
            Native attributes are attributes that are added when creating the class
            after using the implementation provided here. They are the 3rd to be fetched
            when searching for an attribute

        INHERITED:
            Inherited attributes are attributes that are inherited from the parent
            They are always the last ones to be fetched
        ADDED:
            Added attributes are attributes taht are added after the initialization of the class
            They are always the second ones fetched when searching for an attribute
        GETTER:
            Functions that have been added to the getter dictionary returned from this module
            They are the first one fetched when searching an attribute and are automatically called
            with the cls attribute

        **THE DICT**

        The dict table is a table containing all of the added attributes to a Class
        This includes all attributes added after initialization
        -->> THOSE ATTRIBUTES ARE ALWAYS FETCHED **BEFORE** NATIVE AND INHERITED ATTRIBUTES <<--
        As such adding anything to that table will overwrite the native attribute
        For Example:
        Imagine an object with a native "happy" attribute set to true
        print(object.happy)
        >> true
        If we were to then do object.happy = false then
        print(object)
        >> false
        However if we do object.happy = nil then
        print(object.happy)
        >> true
        Because it went back to the native attribute
        ]]--
        class.__dict = dict
        class.__inherited = inherited
        class.__ancestors = ancestors
        class.__name = name
        --[[
        **THE GETTER**
        any function added to the getter table will be called when trying to access an attribute
        Example:
        Imagine a class with a _name method which returns the class' name
            function getter.name(self)
                return self:_name()
            end
        This, put simply, transform a call of object:_name() to object.name
        ]]--
        class.__getter = getter
        names[name] = class
        print('------------------------\n')
        return class, getter
    end})
